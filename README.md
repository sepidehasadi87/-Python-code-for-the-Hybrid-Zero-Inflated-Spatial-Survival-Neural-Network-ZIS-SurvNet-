Python code for theHybrid Zero-InflatedSpatial Survival Neural Network-ZIS-SurvNet-
Key Highlights:
•	The code is structured into several classes representing different components of the ZIS-SurvNet framework.
•	The ZIDWDistributor class has a method to set the zero-inflation probability (pi).
•	The SpatialEmbedding uses a simple linear transformation for spatial features.
•	The model architecture integrates these components effectively and includes a sample usage block to demonstrate functionality.
